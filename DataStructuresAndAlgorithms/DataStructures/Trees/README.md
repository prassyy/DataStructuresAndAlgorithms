##  Trees

### Types of trees:
- Fully binary tree (Every node has 0 or 2 children)
- Complete binary tree (All levels are filled except the last level and it has all nodes as left as possible)
- Perfect binary tree (All the internal nodes have 2 children and all leaf nodes are at same level)
- Balanced binary tree (Height of the tree is O(log N) where N is number of nodes) - ???
- A degenerate or Pathological binary tree (All the internal nodes has one child, it is similar to a linked list)

### Applications:
- Storing Naturally hierarchical data. Eg: File system
- Organising data for quick search, insertion and deletion tasks Eg: Binary Search Trees
- Representing Tries. Used for representing dictionaries for dynamic spell checking, directories for dynamic lookup
- Used in Network routing algorithms
